"""Permission engine.

Every tool call is described as a `PermissionRequest` and checked here before
it runs. Four modes:

    ask    reads run freely; anything that writes, deletes, or executes asks
    auto   reads and file edits run freely; commands still ask
    plan   read-only — mutations are refused, so the model can survey and
           propose without touching anything
    yolo   everything is allowed except the hard-blocked commands below

Rules are strings shaped like the tool call they authorize:

    run_command(git status:*)   any command starting with "git status"
    read_file(*)                any read
    write_file(src/**)          writes under src/
    web_search                  the whole tool, no argument filter
    *                           everything (equivalent to yolo, but explicit)

Deny always beats allow. Familiar aliases (Bash, Read, Write, Edit) are
accepted so rules copied from other agent tools keep working.
