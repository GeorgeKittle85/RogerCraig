"""Subagent definitions.

A subagent is a fresh conversation with its own system prompt, its own
(usually narrower) tool set, and its own iteration budget. It shares the
parent's workspace, permission engine, and UI, so approvals still surface to
the one human at the keyboard, and nothing a subagent does can exceed what the
parent was allowed to do.

Why bother on a local model: context. A search that would take fifteen tool
calls and 40k tokens of file dumps can run inside a subagent and come back as
a paragraph — which matters far more when the context window is 8k than when
it's a million.
